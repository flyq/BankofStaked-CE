# BankofStaked Open Creditor Program

## About BankofStaked

BankofStaked is an EOS resource automatic leasing DAPP developed by EOSLaoMao team ([https://eoslaomao.com/bankofstaked](https://eoslaomao.com/bankofstaked)).

BankofStaked has been online for more than two months since it was launched in October 2018, and has leased out more than 3,000,000 EOS automatically. At the same time, BankofStaked has been providing free emergency plan to the EOS community from day one with supports from 27 Block Producers. To date, BankofStaked has provided free emergency services to more than 30,000 EOS accounts. Wallets such as MEET.ONE, imToken, EOS.LIVE have also integrited free emergency plan into their wallets.

BankofStaked has acheived a ZERO-fund-loss-risk while leasing creditors' EOS out by using EOS permission system cleverly.

Comparing to other platforms, the benefits of being creditor of BankofStaked are as follows:

1. NO EOS transfer needed. Your EOS sits in your account, under your control all the time, which means there's ZERO risk of fund loss.
2. ALL airdrops will be recieved automatically, again, because your EOS sits in your account.
3. Voting right is under your control, too! As a DPOS blockchain, the importance of voting right is self-evident in EOS. You should always control your voting right fully.


## Open Creditor Program
With the development of the EOS ecosystem, BankofStaked's business volume has grown rapidly, and BankofStaked's current creditors have been unable to meet the growing business needs. To this end, we now open a limited amount of BankofStaked's Creditor to qualified EOS token holders.

Since setting up the Creditor account requires a certain knowledge of cleos command line tool, it is important for token holders to decide whether or not to participate after evaluating the risk. BankofStaked is not responsible for problems caused by improper operation or improper settings operated by token holders themselves.
